Milestone Project 3

# Let's Go Hike

This website is my second project after the culmination of studying Practial Python and Data Centric Development, including Flask and the MongoDB database system.

The website can be found at ...

## UX

This website was developed for users who have an interest in hiking within the United Kingdom. They will be greeted on the home page with a landing page
picture with a simple title stating the purpose of the website. For more information on the purpose and benefit of the website users can visit the about page.
Users will be able to implement the CRUD system in order to add, view, edit and delete hikes with useful data presented for other hikers to visit those sites.
Users can also visit a simple contact page if there is something that could or should be changed within the website.
